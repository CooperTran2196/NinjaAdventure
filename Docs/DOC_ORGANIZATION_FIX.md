# ✅ Documentation Organization - Complete

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Changes:** Enforced strict doc location rules

---

## What Was Fixed

### 1. File Locations ✅
- ❌ Removed: `Week_10_Oct15/` folder (we're still in Week 9)
- ✅ Moved: `ITEM_INFO_POPUP_PLAN.md` → `Docs/`
- ✅ Moved: `UNITY_SETUP_GUIDE.md` → `Docs/`
- ✅ Verified: No `.md` files in workspace root

### 2. Updated Rules ✅

**In `Docs/README.md`:**
- Added **CRITICAL documentation rules** section
- Rule 1: ALL new docs go in `Docs/` folder
- Rule 2: Don't create new week folders without user permission
- Rule 3: Current week continues until user says "start Week X"
- Rule 4: WIP docs stay in main `Docs/` until completed
- Updated folder structure to show current WIP files
- Updated status: "Week 9 (still in progress)"

**In `.github/copilot-instructions.md`:**
- Added prominent **Documentation Rules (CRITICAL)** section at top
- References `Docs/README.md` as source of truth
- Clear instructions to NEVER create docs in workspace root

## For AI Agents (Next Chat Session)

**Before creating ANY documentation:**

1. ✅ Read `Docs/README.md` - Documentation Rules section
2. ✅ Read `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Doc location rules
3. ✅ Ask user if starting new week (default: NO, stay in current)
4. ✅ Create ALL docs in `Docs/` folder
5. ❌ NEVER create docs in workspace root
6. ❌ NEVER auto-create new week folders

**Current Status:**
- Week: **Week 9** (Oct 14-18, 2025)
- WIP: Item Info Popup System (code complete, Unity setup pending)
- Next Week: Only when user explicitly says "start Week 10"

---

## Summary

✅ All documentation now in `Docs/` folder  
✅ Rules clearly documented in 2 places  
✅ Week 9 continues until user decides otherwise  
✅ WIP files visible in main `Docs/` folder  
✅ No files polluting workspace root  

**AI agents will now:**
- Always create docs in `Docs/`
- Never auto-create new weeks
- Check rules before creating files
