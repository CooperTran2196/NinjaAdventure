# Enemy System Refactor - Quick Summary

## What Changed?

The enemy AI system now uses **the exact same architecture as the player**, bringing all the benefits of concurrent states, weapon-based movement penalties, and animation locking.

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `State_Attack.cs` (Enemy Attack State)
**Changes:**
- ✅ Added ShowTime animation lock (freeze animation if `showTime > 0.45s`)
- ✅ Added `enabled = false` at end of routine → triggers cleanup
- ✅ Added `GetActiveWeapon()` for chase state to read weapon penalty
- ✅ Enhanced `OnDisable()` with animation speed restoration + chase state restoration
- ✅ Renamed `attackDuration` → `attackAnimDuration` for clarity

**Result:** Attack state properly cleans up, animations freeze/resume correctly, smooth transitions

---

### 2. `State_Chase.cs` (Enemy Chase/Movement State)
**Changes:**
- ✅ Added weapon movement penalty support (reads from `activeWeapon.weaponData.attackMovePenalty`)
- ✅ Added animation priority (attack animation > movement animation)
- ✅ Added concurrent state support (stays enabled during attack)
- ✅ Speed calculation: `speed *= weapon.attackMovePenalty` during attack

**Result:** Enemies move slower with heavy weapons, faster with light weapons, smooth combat feel

---

### 3. `E_Controller.cs` (Enemy AI Controller)
**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `TriggerAttack()` method (like player's version)
- ✅ Modified `ProcessAI()` to allow chase during attack
- ✅ Modified `SwitchState()` to preserve attack state when active
- ✅ Enhanced `SetAttacking()` with automatic state restoration
- ✅ Attack state protected from premature cancellation

**Result:** Enemies can reposition during attacks, automatic state management, concurrent chase + attack

---

## Key Patterns Applied (From Player System)

### ✅ Concurrent States
- **Player:** Movement + Attack can coexist
- **Enemy:** Chase + Attack can coexist
- **Benefit:** Fluid combat, repositioning during attacks

### ✅ Weapon Movement Penalty
- **Player:** Reads `attackMovePenalty` from active weapon
- **Enemy:** Reads `attackMovePenalty` from active weapon
- **Benefit:** Per-weapon combat feel (fast daggers vs slow greatswords)

### ✅ ShowTime Animation Lock
- **Player:** Animation freezes if `showTime > animDuration`
- **Enemy:** Animation freezes if `showTime > animDuration`
- **Benefit:** Long weapon attacks look polished, no animation loops

### ✅ Component Lifecycle
- **Player:** `enabled = false` → `OnDisable()` → cleanup
- **Enemy:** `enabled = false` → `OnDisable()` → cleanup
- **Benefit:** Automatic cleanup, no manual state management

### ✅ State Restoration
- **Player:** Attack ends → restore Move or Idle based on input
- **Enemy:** Attack ends → restore Chase or Default based on target
- **Benefit:** Smooth transitions, no stuck states

## State Flow Comparison

### Player State Flow:
```
Idle → Move (WASD) → Attack (Click) → Attack + Move (concurrent)
                                    ↓
                        Attack ends → Move (if WASD held) or Idle
```

### Enemy State Flow:
```
Idle/Wander → Chase (detect) → Attack (in range) → Attack + Chase (concurrent)
                                                  ↓
                              Attack ends → Chase (if target exists) or Idle/Wander
```

## Example: Heavy Weapon Enemy

```
Enemy: Orc Brute
Weapon: Heavy Axe
  - AD = 15
  - showTime = 1.5f
  - attackMovePenalty = 0.2f (20% speed)
  - thrustDistance = 0.4f

Behavior:
1. Chases player at full speed (MS = 3.0)
2. Enters attack range → TriggerAttack()
3. Attack animation plays (0.45s)
4. Animation freezes at final frame
5. STILL CHASING but at 20% speed (0.6 units/sec)
6. Lockout period (1.05s) with frozen animation
7. Attack ends → full chase speed restored (3.0 units/sec)

Player Experience:
- "Oh no, the orc is attacking!"
- "But it's moving so slow, I can dodge!"
- "Attack finished, now it's fast again!"
```

## Example: Fast Weapon Enemy

```
Enemy: Shadow Assassin
Weapon: Dual Daggers
  - AD = 3
  - showTime = 0.3f
  - attackMovePenalty = 0.75f (75% speed)
  - thrustDistance = 0.2f

Behavior:
1. Chases player at full speed (MS = 5.0)
2. Enters attack range → TriggerAttack()
3. Quick attack (0.3s, no freeze)
4. STILL CHASING at 75% speed (3.75 units/sec)
5. Attack ends almost immediately
6. Back to full chase speed (5.0 units/sec)

Player Experience:
- "Fast enemy incoming!"
- "It barely slows down when attacking!"
- "Can't outrun it, must fight or dodge!"
```

## Configuration Guide

### Making a Fast Aggressive Enemy
```
Stats:
  MS = 5.0 (fast)
  attackCooldown = 0.5f (spam attacks)

Weapon:
  showTime = 0.3f (quick)
  attackMovePenalty = 0.8f (stay mobile)
  AD = 3 (low damage)

Result: Hit-and-run, hard to escape
```

### Making a Slow Powerful Enemy
```
Stats:
  MS = 2.0 (slow)
  attackCooldown = 2.0f (infrequent)

Weapon:
  showTime = 2.0f (long)
  attackMovePenalty = 0.2f (very slow)
  AD = 20 (high damage)

Result: Telegraphed attacks, high risk/reward
```
