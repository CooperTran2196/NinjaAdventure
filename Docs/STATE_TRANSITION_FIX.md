# State Transition Fix - Attack & Dodge Completion

## Problems Fixed

### Problem 1: Attack ends while moving → isMoving never turns back on
**Symptom:** Player attacks while moving → attack finishes → player stuck in attack state, can't see walk animation even though moving

**Root Cause:**
- Attack ends → `P_State_Attack` disabled → `OnDisable()` checks `P_State_Movement.enabled`
- But `currentState` still = `Attack` in controller
- `P_State_Movement.Update()` checks: `if (currentState == Attack)` → keeps `isMoving = false`
- Movement animation never restored ❌

### Problem 2: Dodge ends while moving → stuck in dodge state
**Symptom:** Player dodges while holding WASD → dodge finishes → stays in dodge state forever

**Root Cause:**
- `DodgeRoutine()` finished → `SetDodging(false)` called
- But dodge state component **never disabled** → `OnDisable()` never called
- `currentState` still = `Dodge`
- `ProcessInputs()` checks: `if (isDodging) return;` → always returns early
- No state transitions possible ❌

## Solutions Implemented

### Fix 1: Disable State Components When Routines Finish

#### `P_State_Dodge.cs`
```csharp
// BEFORE (broken)
IEnumerator DodgeRoutine()
{
    yield return new WaitForSeconds(dodgeDuration);
    controller.SetDodging(false); // Only sets flag
    // Component stays enabled ❌
}

// AFTER (fixed)
IEnumerator DodgeRoutine()
{
    yield return new WaitForSeconds(dodgeDuration);
    controller.SetDodging(false);
    enabled = false; // ✅ Triggers OnDisable()
}
```

### Fix 2: State Restoration in SetAttacking() and SetDodging()

#### `P_Controller.cs` - Enhanced State Setters
```csharp
public void SetAttacking(bool value)
{
    isAttacking = value;
    
    // When attack ends, restore proper state based on current input
    if (!value && currentState == PState.Attack)
    {
        // Check if player is currently moving
        if (move.enabled && moveAxis.sqrMagnitude > MIN_DISTANCE)
        {
            currentState = PState.Move; // ✅ Restore Move state
        }
        else
        {
            SwitchState(PState.Idle); // ✅ Return to Idle
        }
    }
}

public void SetDodging(bool value)
{
    isDodging = value;
    
    // When dodge ends, restore proper state based on current input
    if (!value && currentState == PState.Dodge)
    {
        // Check if player is currently moving
        if (moveAxis.sqrMagnitude > MIN_DISTANCE)
        {
            move.enabled = true;
            move.SetMoveAxis(moveAxis);
            currentState = PState.Move; // ✅ Restore Move state
        }
        else
        {
            SwitchState(PState.Idle); // ✅ Return to Idle
        }
    }
}
```

### Fix 3: Protect Dodge State in ProcessInputs()

#### `P_Controller.cs` - Updated State Tracking
```csharp
// Update state tracking: Switch to Move if not attacking or dodging
if (currentState != PState.Attack && currentState != PState.Dodge)
{
    currentState = PState.Move;
}

// Update state to Idle only if not attacking or dodging
if (currentState != PState.Attack && currentState != PState.Dodge)
{
    SwitchState(PState.Idle);
}
```

## Complete Flow Analysis

### Scenario 1: Attack While Moving → Attack Ends → Keep Moving

```
Frame 1-10: Attack + Move
  → currentState = Attack
  → isAttacking = true
  → P_State_Attack enabled
  → P_State_Movement enabled
  → isMoving = false (forced by P_State_Movement.Update)
  → Attack animation plays ✅

Frame 11: Attack finishes
  → AttackRoutine() completes
  → controller.SetAttacking(false)
  → Check: currentState == Attack? Yes
  → Check: moveAxis > MIN_DISTANCE? Yes
  → currentState = PState.Move ✅
  → enabled = false → P_State_Attack.OnDisable()
  
Frame 12+: Movement continues
  → currentState = Move
  → P_State_Movement.Update():
    → currentState == Attack? No ✅
    → isMoving = true ✅
  → Walk animation plays ✅
```

### Scenario 2: Attack While Moving → Stop Moving → Attack Ends

```
Frame 1-10: Attack + Move
  → currentState = Attack, moving

Frame 11: Release WASD (during attack)
  → ProcessInputs(): moveAxis = 0
  → move.enabled = false
  → currentState still = Attack (protected)

Frame 15: Attack finishes
  → SetAttacking(false)
  → Check: move.enabled? No
  → Check: moveAxis > MIN_DISTANCE? No
  → SwitchState(PState.Idle) ✅
  → Idle animation plays ✅
```

### Scenario 3: Dodge While Moving → Dodge Ends → Keep Moving

```
Frame 1-5: Dodge
  → currentState = Dodge
  → isDodging = true
  → P_State_Dodge enabled
  → Dodge animation plays

Frame 6-10: Dodge + WASD held
  → ProcessInputs(): isDodging = true → return early
  → No state changes (protected)

Frame 11: Dodge finishes
  → DodgeRoutine() completes
  → controller.SetDodging(false)
  → Check: currentState == Dodge? Yes
  → Check: moveAxis > MIN_DISTANCE? Yes
  → move.enabled = true ✅
  → move.SetMoveAxis(moveAxis) ✅
  → currentState = PState.Move ✅
  → enabled = false → P_State_Dodge.OnDisable()

Frame 12+: Movement continues
  → ProcessInputs() runs normally
  → moveAxis detected → Move state maintained
  → Walk animation plays ✅
```

### Scenario 4: Dodge While Moving → Stop Moving → Dodge Ends

```
Frame 1-10: Dodge + Move

Frame 11: Release WASD (during dodge)
  → ProcessInputs(): isDodging = true → return early
  → No state processing (protected)

Frame 15: Dodge finishes
  → SetDodging(false)
  → Check: moveAxis > MIN_DISTANCE? No
  → SwitchState(PState.Idle) ✅
  → Idle animation plays ✅
```

## State Component Lifecycle Matrix

| Event | Attack Component | Dodge Component | Move Component | Current State | isAttacking | isDodging |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| Idle | disabled | disabled | disabled | Idle | false | false |
| Start Moving | disabled | disabled | **enabled** | Move | false | false |
| Attack (moving) | **enabled** | disabled | **enabled** | Attack | true | false |
| Attack ends (still moving) | **disabled** | disabled | **enabled** | **Move** ✅ | false | false |
| Attack ends (stopped) | **disabled** | disabled | disabled | Idle | false | false |
| Start Dodge | disabled | **enabled** | disabled | Dodge | false | true |
| Dodge (with WASD held) | disabled | **enabled** | disabled | Dodge | false | true |
| Dodge ends (still holding WASD) | disabled | **disabled** | **enabled** ✅ | **Move** ✅ | false | false |
| Dodge ends (released WASD) | disabled | **disabled** | disabled | Idle | false | false |

## Animation State Matrix

| Scenario | isAttacking | isMoving | isDodging | Animation |
|----------|-------------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Idle | false | false | false | Idle |
| Moving | false | true | false | Walk |
| Attack (standing) | true | false | false | Attack |
| Attack (moving) | true | **false** | false | Attack |
| **Attack ends → Moving** | **false** | **true** ✅ | false | **Walk** ✅ |
| **Attack ends → Idle** | **false** | false | false | **Idle** ✅ |
| Dodge | false | false | true | Dodge |
| **Dodge ends → Moving** | false | **true** ✅ | false | **Walk** ✅ |
| **Dodge ends → Idle** | false | false | false | **Idle** ✅ |

## Files Modified

1. **`P_State_Dodge.cs`**
   - Added `enabled = false;` at end of `DodgeRoutine()`
   - Ensures `OnDisable()` is called when dodge finishes

2. **`P_Controller.cs`**
   - Enhanced `SetAttacking()` with state restoration logic
   - Enhanced `SetDodging()` with state restoration logic
   - Updated `ProcessInputs()` to protect Dodge state like Attack state

## Key Benefits

✅ Attack ends while moving → Walk animation resumes automatically  
✅ Attack ends while idle → Idle animation plays  
✅ Dodge ends while moving → Walk animation resumes automatically  
✅ Dodge ends while idle → Idle animation plays  
✅ No stuck states  
✅ Smooth state transitions  
✅ Proper animation priority maintained  
✅ State components properly cleaned up via `OnDisable()`  

## Logic Error Checks Performed

### ✅ Check 1: State Component Lifecycle
- Attack/Dodge components properly enabled when triggered
- Attack/Dodge components properly disabled when finished
- `OnDisable()` called correctly to clean up animator bools

### ✅ Check 2: State Transition Logic
- Attack → Move (when moving continues)
- Attack → Idle (when stopped)
- Dodge → Move (when moving continues)
- Dodge → Idle (when stopped)

### ✅ Check 3: Animation Bool Management
- `isAttacking` set to true when attack starts
- `isAttacking` set to false when attack ends
- `isMoving` set to false during attack (priority)
- `isMoving` restored to true after attack (if moving)
- `isDodging` set to true when dodge starts
- `isDodging` set to false when dodge ends

### ✅ Check 4: Input Processing
- Movement input always processed (except during dodge)
- Attack doesn't block movement input
- Dodge blocks all input during execution
- State restoration happens automatically

### ✅ Check 5: Edge Cases
- ✅ Attack while moving → move during attack → attack ends → keep moving
- ✅ Attack while moving → stop during attack → attack ends → idle
- ✅ Attack while idle → start moving during attack → attack ends → moving
- ✅ Dodge while moving → keep moving → dodge ends → keep moving
- ✅ Dodge while moving → stop during dodge → dodge ends → idle
- ✅ Dodge while idle → start moving (blocked) → dodge ends → check current input

### ✅ Check 6: Concurrent States
- Move + Attack can coexist (attack has animation priority)
- Move component stays enabled during attack
- Move component properly manages `isMoving` based on `currentState`

### ✅ Check 7: Death Override
- Death force-disables all states
- No memory leaks or lingering coroutines

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Attack while standing → finishes → idle ✅
- [x] Attack while moving → finishes → walk animation resumes ✅
- [x] Attack while moving → stop during attack → finishes → idle ✅
- [x] Attack while idle → move during attack → finishes → walk ✅
- [x] Dodge while standing → finishes → idle ✅
- [x] Dodge while moving → finishes → walk animation resumes ✅
- [x] Dodge while moving → stop during dodge → finishes → idle ✅
- [x] Multiple attacks in sequence ✅

## Notes

- State restoration is **automatic** via enhanced `SetAttacking()` and `SetDodging()`
- `moveAxis` is always up-to-date from `ProcessInputs()`, so we can reliably check it
- Component disabling (`enabled = false`) triggers Unity's `OnDisable()` lifecycle
- This creates a clean, self-healing state machine
- No manual state tracking needed - the system self-corrects
