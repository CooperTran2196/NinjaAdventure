7. [State Transition Fix](STATE_TRANSITION_FIX.md) - State management
8. [Animation Priority](ANIMATION_PRIORITY_FIX.md) - Animation system
9. [Attack State Cleanup](ATTACK_STATE_CLEANUP_FIX.md) - Edge cases

### Phase 3: Enemy AI System
8. Then: [Enemy State System](ENEMY_STATE_SYSTEM.md) - Full enemy AI refactor applying all player patterns

### Phase 4: Advanced Combat
9. Read: [Attack Combo System Design](COMBO_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md) - 3-hit combo design plan
10. Then: [Combo Implementation Summary](COMBO_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md) - How it all works together
8. Finally: [Enemy State System](ENEMY_STATE_SYSTEM.md) - Same architecture applied to enemies

### Key Components

**Player:**
- **P_Controller**: Central state manager, handles input and state transitions
- **P_State_Attack**: Attack timing, weapon invocation, animation freeze
- **P_State_Movement**: Movement velocity, penalty application, animation control

**Enemy:**
- **E_Controller**: AI state manager, handles target detection and attack logic
- **State_Attack**: Attack timing, weapon invocation, animation freeze, state restoration
- **State_Chase**: Chase movement, penalty application during attack, animation control

**Shared:**
- **W_Base**: Weapon base class, anchoring system (used by both player and enemy)
- **W_SO**: Weapon ScriptableObject, data-driven design (attackMovePenalty, showTime)

## üîß Quick Reference

### Attack Movement Penalty (Per Weapon)
```csharp
// In W_SO.cs
[Range(0f, 1f)]
public float attackMovePenalty = 0.5f;

// Fast weapons: 0.7-0.8 (mobile)
// Medium weapons: 0.5-0.6 (balanced)
// Slow weapons: 0.2-0.4 (sluggish)
```

### Weapon ShowTime
```csharp
// In W_SO.cs
public float showTime = 0.3f;

// If showTime > 0.45f (animation duration):
// ‚Üí Animation freezes at final frame
// ‚Üí Player locked until showTime completes
```

### State Component Lifecycle
```csharp
// Enable state
component.enabled = true;
‚Üí OnEnable() called
‚Üí Animator bools set

// Disable state
component.enabled = false;
‚Üí OnDisable() called
‚Üí Cleanup animator bools
```

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Weapon floats away from player
**Solution:** Check [WEAPON_ANCHOR_CHANGES.md](WEAPON_ANCHOR_CHANGES.md)
- Weapon should parent to owner during attack
- EndVisual() should restore original parent

### Issue: Player stuck in attack animation
**Solution:** Check [ATTACK_STATE_CLEANUP_FIX.md](ATTACK_STATE_CLEANUP_FIX.md)
- Ensure `enabled = false` in AttackRoutine()
- Check OnDisable() is called

### Issue: Movement animation doesn't resume after attack
**Solution:** Check [STATE_TRANSITION_FIX.md](STATE_TRANSITION_FIX.md) (Player) or [ENEMY_STATE_SYSTEM.md](ENEMY_STATE_SYSTEM.md) (Enemy)
- SetAttacking(false) should restore state
- Check moveAxis/target still has input

### Issue: Both attack and walk animations playing
**Solution:** Check [ANIMATION_PRIORITY_FIX.md](ANIMATION_PRIORITY_FIX.md) (Player) or [ENEMY_STATE_SYSTEM.md](ENEMY_STATE_SYSTEM.md) (Enemy)
- P_State_Movement / State_Chase should set isMoving = false during attack
- Attack animation has priority

### Issue: Enemy stuck in attack state
**Solution:** Check [ENEMY_STATE_SYSTEM.md](ENEMY_STATE_SYSTEM.md)
- Ensure `enabled = false` in State_Attack.AttackRoutine()
- Check State_Attack.OnDisable() restores chase state
- Verify E_Controller.SetAttacking(false) is called
