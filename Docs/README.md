1. **Weekly Folders:** `Week_X_[MonthDay-Day]/` for all completed work
2. **File Numbers:** Prefix with `1_`, `2_`, `3_`... (order completed)
3. **Week README:** Each week needs summary of all systems
4. **Dates:** Include created/completed dates in week docs
5. **Status:** ✅ Complete | 📊 Reference | 🚧 TODO | ⭐ Latest
6. **Main Clean:** Only week folders + balance refs + TODOs in main Docs/
7. **Consolidate:** Merge similar docs, delete old scattered files
8. **Short READMEs:** Navigation only - technical details in week folders
9. **New Week:** Create folder → work → number files → summary → update main
10. **Complete TODOs:** Move to week folder when done
