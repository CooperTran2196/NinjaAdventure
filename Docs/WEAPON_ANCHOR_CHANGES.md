# Weapon Anchoring Update - Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved
Weapons now **stay anchored to the player's center** during long showTime attacks, even when the player moves. Previously, weapons would spawn at a world position and stay there, causing them to "float" in place when the player moved away.

## Solution Overview
Implemented **Option 1: Parent-based anchoring** - weapons are temporarily parented to the owner (player/enemy) during attacks, making them automatically follow the owner's movement.

## Files Modified

### 1. `W_Base.cs` - Core Changes
**Added:**
- `Transform originalParent` - stores the weapon's original parent to restore after attacks
- `EndVisual()` - new method to hide weapon and restore parent hierarchy

**Modified:**
- `Awake()` - now stores `originalParent = transform.parent`
- `GetPolarPosition()` - now returns **local offset** instead of world position (removed `owner.position +`)
- `BeginVisual()` - now uses `SetParent(owner)` and sets `localPosition`/`localRotation`
- `ThrustOverTime()` - now uses `transform.localPosition` for thrust motion in local space

### 2. `W_Melee.cs`
**Modified:**
- `Hit()` coroutine:
  - Changed variable name from `posision` to `localPosition` for clarity
  - Replaced manual hide code with `EndVisual()` call

### 3. `W_Ranged.cs`
**Modified:**
- `Shoot()` coroutine:
  - Changed variable name from `posision` to `localPosition` for clarity
  - Replaced `sprite.enabled = false` with `EndVisual()` call
- `FireProjectile()`:
  - Added comment clarifying use of `transform.position` (world position) for projectile spawn
  - Renamed `currentPosition` to `currentWorldPosition` for clarity

## How It Works

### Before (Old System)
1. Calculate world position: `owner.position + (attackDir * offsetRadius)`
2. Set weapon to that world position
3. Thrust in world space
4. **Problem:** If player moves, weapon stays at original world position

### After (New System)
1. Calculate **local** offset: `attackDir * offsetRadius`
2. Parent weapon to owner: `SetParent(owner)`
3. Set weapon's **local** position and rotation
4. Thrust in **local** space (relative to owner)
5. When done, restore original parent: `SetParent(originalParent)`
6. **Result:** Weapon follows owner automatically during entire attack

## Key Benefits
✅ Weapons stay centered on player even with long `showTime` values  
✅ Works for both melee and ranged weapons  
✅ Minimal code changes (backward compatible)  
✅ No performance impact  
✅ Automatic - no per-frame position updates needed  

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test melee weapon with short showTime (0.3s)
- [ ] Test melee weapon with long showTime (2s+) while moving
- [ ] Test ranged weapon attacks while moving
- [ ] Verify projectiles still spawn at correct position
- [ ] Test with both player and enemy weapons
- [ ] Check weapon hierarchy is restored after attack

## Notes
- The weapon now operates in **local space** during attacks
- `transform.position` still gives world position when needed (e.g., projectile spawning)
- Original parent is always restored, maintaining proper scene hierarchy
- No changes needed to weapon ScriptableObjects or prefabs
