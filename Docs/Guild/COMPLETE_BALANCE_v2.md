## üëæ Enemy Rebalance (Based on New Player Stats)

### **Player Damage Calculation**
```
Early Game: 5 AD + 8 weapon AD (Katana) = 13 damage/hit
Mid Game (maxed AR): 5 AD + 8 weapon AD, enemy has ~5 AR = ~12 damage/hit
Late Game (with lifesteal): 5 AD + 8 weapon AD + 25% lifesteal = ~3.25 HP per hit
```

## üéÆ Balance Philosophy Summary

**Early Game (0-10 skill points):**
- Player: 100-140 HP, 4.0-5.0 MS, 0-10 AR
- Can kill Archer/Scout comfortably
- Struggles with Warrior (mini-boss feel)
- Bruiser/Tank are very dangerous

**Mid Game (10-30 skill points):**
- Player: 140-180 HP, 5.0-6.0 MS, 10-20 AR, 10-15% lifesteal
- Can kill Warrior comfortably
- Bruiser is challenging but fair
- Tank is boss-tier

**Late Game (30-55 skill points):**
- Player: 180-200 HP, 6.0-6.5 MS, 20-25 AR, 20-25% lifesteal
- Can handle mixed encounters
- Tank becomes fair 1v1
- Multiple Bruisers/Warriors = challenge

**Weapon Choice Matters:**
- Katana: Balanced, good for learning
- Greatsword: High risk/reward, burst damage
- Daggers: Safe, low commitment, hit and run
- Spear: Poke/kite, range advantage
- Staff: Ranged, mana management, AoE potential

This creates a smooth power curve where skill points feel impactful and weapon choice creates strategic depth! üéØ
